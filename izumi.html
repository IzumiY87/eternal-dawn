    <h1>Izumi</h1>

    <p><span class="label">Age:</span> 17</p>
    <p><span class="label">Role:</span> Captain of the Eyepatch Pirates</p>
    <p><span class="label">Cursed Eye:</span> Left (Red Flame)</p>

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>Izumi wears an eyepatch over his glowing red cursed eye, with black hair and a lithe pirate's build. His normal eye is a deep black, often stern and calculating when focused in battle.</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>Brave, impulsive, righteous, and filled with a burning sense of purpose. Izumi is both a charismatic leader and a relentless dreamer who believes the seas can be free of suffering. He has a poor sense of direction but an unshakable compass when it comes to morality and loyalty to his crew.</p>

    <h2>Powers</h2>
    <p>Izumi is cursed with ancient divine fire. His cursed eye grants him powerful abilities like explosive flame projection, cursed vision, and enhanced reflexes—but if overused, it threatens to consume his soul. His connection to the god Sol’mar makes him one half of the Twin Flamebearers.</p>

    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>Separated from his twin brother Izana during infancy by forces protecting the world from the truth, Izumi grew up alone, haunted by visions and cursed power. With no knowledge of his family, he sailed the seas to chase strength, freedom, and meaning. Founding the Eyepatch Pirates with his first mate Keal, he stole his ship from a shipyard and began gathering a crew of outcasts and warriors. Along the journey, he fought Soraya, a cursed manipulator who sought his power, and met Sota, a mysterious mage who helped him understand his curse. In Saga 3, his journey takes him to Eclipse Haven, where he finally meets Izana and learns of their divine destiny as flamebearers chosen by Sol’mar.</p>
