    <h1>Izana</h1>

    <p><span class="label">Age:</span> 17</p>
    <p><span class="label">Role:</span> Captain of the Spade Pirates</p>
    <p><span class="label">Cursed Eye:</span> Right (Blue Flame)</p>

    <h2>Appearance</h2>
    <p>Stoic and refined, Izana has sharp features, calm blue eyes, and a commanding presence. Unlike Izumi, he wears no eyepatch—his cursed right eye glows faintly with blue fire. His clothing is tactical and clean, suited for silent combat and leadership.</p>

    <h2>Personality</h2>
    <p>Disciplined, focused, and a natural-born leader. Izana contrasts Izumi in his calm calculation and restraint. He doesn’t speak often, but when he does, his crew listens. Beneath his stern exterior lies a deep sense of justice and a hidden sorrow for the brother he lost.</p>

    <h2>Powers</h2>
    <p>Izana’s cursed eye contains divine flame, similar to Izumi’s, but is infused with cold-burning blue fire. His control over the curse is exceptional, allowing him to create flame barriers, illusions, and spiritual bonds. His power awakens further after the Eclipse Trial in Saga 3.</p>

    <h2>Backstory</h2>
    <p>Separated from Izumi at birth by the secretive Flamebound order, Izana was raised in the shadows of the Council’s war. He was trained as both a weapon and a leader, unaware that his twin brother was alive. Upon discovering the truth of his origins and the legend of Sol’mar, Izana defected from his handlers and formed the Spade Pirates, seeking to restore balance and truth to the seas. His reunion with Izumi in Eclipse Haven was a long-awaited moment that reconnected two halves of the same destiny.</p>

    <h2>Saga 3 Growth</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Awakens the blue divine flame of the right cursed eye.</li>
      <li>Reunites with his twin brother, Izumi.</li>
      <li>Fights alongside the Eyepatch Pirates in Eclipse Haven.</li>
      <li>Becomes co-bearer of the Twin Flame legacy.</li>
      <li>Stands against the Quiet Architect’s agents.</li>
    </ul>

      <li><strong>Koya:</strong> His loyal vice captain and tactical equal.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Current Bounty</h2>
    <p><span class="label">1.1 billion Quer</span> — Recognized by the world as a divine threat. Awakened cursed eye and flamebearer powers mark him as a priority target by the Council.</p>
